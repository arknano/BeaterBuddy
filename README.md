# BeaterBuddy

A third-party app for listening to tracks on [WeeklyBeats](https://weeklybeats.com/).
BeaterBuddy's goal is to provide new ways to listen to music created by the WeeklyBeats community that aren't supported by the website.

All of the content presented within BeaterBuddy is publically available on WeeklyBeats, but if you'd like to opt-out of your tracks being available in the app for any reason, please file an issue including a link to your WeeklyBeats profile, or get in touch with Judgement Act on the [WeeklyBeats Discord](https://discord.gg/0kU3kZBMEa4U5r8r).

BeaterBuddy is created with the support but not the endorsement of the WeeklyBeats organisers.
